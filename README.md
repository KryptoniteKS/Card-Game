# Card Game
This project showcases a possible solution to card games in Unreal Engine using Widget Blueprints. In the end, you will have a "hand" that shows all the cards in your hand. You can add and remove cards from this hand, reposition cards in your hand, and play cards. Cards in your hand will automatically reposition themselves to form an arc formation akin to a set of cards in real life.

This functionality will be used later on in a project I plan on publishing on Steam in the future.
